## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a SOSBlood application.

## The problem we are trying to solve

It is not something surprising that the blood transfusions centers all over the world are suffering from a lack of stock. and with the pandemic the situation has become even worse and delicate.

Before the blood stock in a lot of countries allows in these best cases to cover the needs of 15 days of consumption. Nevertheless, with the covid19 it barely arrives at a stock of 24 hours. the situation is therefore become critical and terrible !! And it is more or less almost the same situation everywhere in the world. The same for a person with a rare blood type it is even worse if he ever has  something bad happens suddenly,  probably he will lose his life if he doesnt know a person who have the same sangauin type.

## The solution

1- Allow the users to announce the needed blood type, when ever they need to. And so can the other users see them.

2- Provide a way of communication between those who needs blood, especially the rare types, with those who wants to donate blood.

3- A section of social advice and documentation on donating blood to raise awareness and support demanders and donors.

4- Our application will send a reminder message to the donors after 3 months to remind them of the possibility of donating blood.

## The Impact

The impact of our app on society is achieved by helping people when they are weak, minimizing donor search time, and most importantly, saving lives.
